# Flask Application with MongoDB and CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a Flask web application with MongoDB integration. It includes unit tests for the applicationâ€™s routes and database operations, and the tests are automatically run using GitHub Actions whenever code is pushed to the repository.

## Unit Tests

### 1. Route Test
- **Test Purpose:** Ensure that the `/products` route returns a `405` status code when an invalid method (e.g., `POST`) is used.
- **Test Logic:** The test sends a `POST` request to `/products` and verifies that the server returns a `405 Method Not Allowed` status code.

### 2. Database Read Test
- **Test Purpose:** Ensure that the MongoDB connection is working by performing a ping to the MongoDB server.
- **Test Logic:** The test attempts to send a `ping` command to MongoDB, and if the connection is successful, the test passes.

### 3. Database Write Test
- **Test Purpose:** Ensure that documents can be inserted into the MongoDB database.
- **Test Logic:** The test inserts a product into the `products` collection and verifies that the document is successfully stored in the database.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions, which automates the process of:
1. Installing dependencies.
2. Running unit tests.
3. Uploading test results as artifacts.

### Pipeline Workflow
- **Trigger:** The pipeline runs automatically on any `push` or `pull request` to the `main` branch.
- **Steps:**
  1. Checkout the repository.
  2. Set up Python and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  3. Run the unit tests located in the `tests/` directory.
  4. Upload the test results as artifacts (optional).

The CI/CD pipeline ensures that the application is continuously tested with every change, helping maintain code quality.
